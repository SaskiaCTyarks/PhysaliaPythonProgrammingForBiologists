        "To make your Python code runnable from the command line there are a few main steps. Any code you have written or used this week should be equally comfortable on a local computer or a Jupyter notebook, and it just requires informing the code where it is.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stages for creating an independent python program\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Open a new file for your script**: Write your Python code in a file with a .py extension - it is not technically essential but good practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Define the shebang line**: The first line of your script must include a shebang line to specify that it is Python and which interpreter to be used. This ensures that the correct Python version is invoked when running the script.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "` #!/usr/bin/python`\n",

        "\n",
        "This will vary depending on your computer. Typing ```which python``` on the command line will show you what to use.\n",

        "3. **Write your code!**: Now's the time to put all your code in there. Once you're finished, save and exit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Add executable permissions**: If you are working on a Unix/Linux system (macs are a unix system), you need to make your Python script executable by assigning the appropriate permissions. Use the chmod command to set the executable permission:\n",
        "\n",
        "        chmod +x script.py\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Run the script**: On the terminal move to the directory where your Python script is located, and run the script using ```./script.py```. If you have set up the shebang line correctly it shouldn't need you to specify python, but you can optionally do that if required: ```python script.py```\n",
